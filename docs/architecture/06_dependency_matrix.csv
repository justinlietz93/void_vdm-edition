# Dependency Matrix Analysis
# Legend: 1 = Component (row) depends on component (column), 0 = No dependency
# Cycle Detection: NO cycles detected in current architecture
# 
# Key Metrics:
# - Fan-out (max dependencies from one component): ChatThread = 5
# - Fan-in (max components depending on one): EditCode = 3, ContextGather = 2
# - Instability Score (I = Fan-out / (Fan-in + Fan-out)):
#   - ChatThread: 5/5 = 1.0 (highly unstable, expected for application layer)
#   - EditCode: 2/5 = 0.4 (moderately stable)
#   - Settings: 0/4 = 0.0 (highly stable, expected for infrastructure)
# 
# Architecture Quality:
# ✅ No circular dependencies detected
# ✅ Clear layered architecture (Presentation → Application → Infrastructure)
# ✅ Stable core with unstable periphery (good design)
